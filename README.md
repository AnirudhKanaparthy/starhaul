# Star Haul
It is an algorithm that calculates the most efficient way to complete a given set of tasks/contracts in Star Citizen. As of now it optimizes for distance and the amount of times you have to land on a station.

## Quick Start (TODO)
Sorry, as of now you can access the simulation/search mechanism programmatically. I am working on a good CLI for making things easy.

## Why?
I created this to maximize my productivity in Star Citizen hauling. I realised early on that I can optimize my routes by doing more than one contract at a time.

## Future work:
1. Proper CLI which takes in a yaml file as a description
2. Have an internal database of all the locations in Star Citizen and the distances between them.
3. Optimize for other parameters like, capital expenditures, danger of a trip etc
